/**
 * Trees are hierarchical data structures.
 * A tree whose nodes have at most 2 children is called a binary tree.
 *
 * Properties
 * Edge - connection between one node to another.
 * Path - a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
 * Height - the height of a node is the number of edges towards the longest downward path from
 * that node to a leaf node.
 * Depth - the depth of a node is the number of edges from that node to the tree's root node.
 * Level - the level of a node is the number of parent nodes from that node until the root node.
 * The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l.
 * The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^(h+1)–1.
 * The minimum number of nodes in binary tree of height ‘h’ is h+1.
 * The maximum height of binary tree with ‘n’ nodes is n-1.
 * The minimum height of binary tree with ‘n’ nodes is floor(log2n) or ceil(log2(n+1)-1).
 *
 * Types
 * In full binary tree every node has either 0 or 2 children.
 * In Complete Binary Tree all levels are completely filled
 * except possibly the last level where the leaf nodes lean towards left.
 * In Perfect Binary Tree all the internal nodes have two children and
 * all leaf nodes are at the same level.
 * A degenerate or pathological tree has a single child either left or right associated with a parent node.
 * A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by
 * the left nodes or the right nodes.
